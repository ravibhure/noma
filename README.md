NoMa: Node Management with good taste!
======================================

Node Management: a web interface for managing the configuration of nodes

Current status: setting up the project. There is no usable code yet.

Noma will be a webbased interface for managing large collections of nodes.

We're currently using the following technologies:

 * CodeIgniter
 * Datamapper ORM
 * Smarty
 * jQuery
 * DataTables

Initially the project will provide support for CFEngine, but the database
design is pretty flexibile, and support for other backends should be
relatively easy to add.
