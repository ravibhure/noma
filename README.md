Noma: Node Management with good taste!
======================================

A web interface for managing the configuration of (large) collections of nodes

Current status
--------------

We are currently in the process of setting up the project. There is no usable
code yet.

About
-----

Noma will be a webbased interface for managing large collections of nodes.

We're currently using the following technologies:

 * PHP 5
 * Symfony 2 (with Doctrine, Twig, phpunit, ...)
 * jQuery
 * Twitter Bootstrap

We develop using a MySQL database, but the software should be able to support
any database the framework (Symfony / Doctrine) supports.

Initially the project will provide support for just CFEngine, but the database
design is pretty flexible, and support for other backends should be relatively
easy to add.
