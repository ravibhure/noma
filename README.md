Noma: Node Management with good taste!
======================================

a web interface for managing the configuration of (large) collections of nodes

Current status: setting up the project. There is no usable code yet.

Noma will be a webbased interface for managing large collections of nodes.

We're currently using the following technologies:

 * PHP 5
 * CodeIgniter
 * Datamapper ORM
 * Smarty
 * jQuery
 * DataTables

We develop using a MySQL database, but the software should be able to support
any database the framework (CodeIgniter) supports.

Initially the project will provide support for CFEngine, but the database
design is pretty flexible, and support for other backends should be relatively
easy to add.
